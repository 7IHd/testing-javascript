# 1.3 Encapsulate and Isolate Tests by building a JavaScript Testing Framework

Our test utility's job is to make it easier for people to quickly identify what's broken so they can fix it quickly. We do that by having a more helpful error message and by running all of the tests in our file.

See example, [testing-framework.js](./testing-framework.js)

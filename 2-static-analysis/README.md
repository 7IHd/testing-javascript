# 2. Static Analysis Testing JavaScript Applications
We could write a bunch of automated tests for our entire codebase, but that would probably be too much work and would slow development down to be worth the benefit.

Luckily, there are tools we can use.

## [2.1 Lint JavaScript by configuring and running ESLint](2.1/)
## [2.2 Format Code by installing and running Prettier](2.2/)
## [2.3 Configure Prettier](2.3/)
## [2.4 Disable Unnecessary ESLint Stylistic Rules with eslint-config-prettier](2.4/)
## [2.5 Validate all files are formatted when linting](2.5/)
## [2.6 Static Analysis Testing JavaScript Application](2.6/)
